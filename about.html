            Wonder why you are reading this amid a pandemic? These uncertain
            times are exactly when taking action, making change, and creating
            a better future are more important than ever. Precisely why I am
            running to be President of the Student Union Assembly.<br /><br />

            Hey UCSC,<br />
            I am Shivika Sivakumar (she/her/hers), a second year Computer Science

            social good.<br />

            My primary goals as President are to:</p><br />
          <ul class="unordered-list" style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif">
            <li>Rebuild connections with students and mend relationships with organizations to increase transparency
              and outreach.</li>
            <li>Reform SUA to better address campus problems and implement actual changes that address key student
              issues.</li>
            <li>Represent students and be the voice of the UCSC student body when talking to admin, faculty, city, and
              the UC system.</li>
          </ul>

            And my platform to addresses these goals is <a href="platform.html">
              C-H-A-N-G-E</a><br />

            <p>
              A group of ten undergraduate students from UC Santa Cruz are
              organizing GraceHacks—a 12-hour all-female and non-binary
              hackathon. “From a personal experience, many of my female and
              non-binary friends, even though good at coding, are hesitant
              to attend regular hackathons as they fear their skills will be
              judged due to the prevalent stereotype of women not being
              smart enough for tech,” says Shivika Sivakumar, Technology
              Lead for the GraceHacks team.

          Nineteen years, seven schools, five states and two countries
          is my story. The world I come from is an interesting combination of Gujarati dandia, Delhi weather,
          Hyderabadi biryani, Bangalore traffic, Cupertino boba, and Santa Cruz beaches. As an Air Force Officer’s
          daughter, I had been to many states within India and moving to new places was routine for me. With every
          place, came new friends and opportunity to celebrate new festivals and traditions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9 mt-sm-20 mb-4 mt-20">
        <p>
          However, coming to California during freshman year of high school was a much more significant change as this time, it was
          moving between countries rather than states. This time, there were substantial barriers to overcome like
          adjusting to an American accent instead of British, using dollars instead of rupees, and driving on the
          right side of the road instead of left.

          But, along with adversities came opportunities to understand and
          experience cultural and societal differences. By handling negative stereotypes like “How do you know
          English, aren’t you from India?” in a humorous way, I chose to embrace the change and learn about
          Thanksgiving, the Civil War, and Pearl Milk Tea. Rather than confronting challenges like having to adjust to
          a completely new school system and curriculum with hostility, I chose to comprehend the new attributes and
          welcome the differences with a smile. By focusing more on opportunities than struggles, I overcame the
          initial setbacks with ease and grace.

      <div class="col-md-9 mt-20">
        <p>
          My experiences helped me to be flexible and adaptable to any new problem in life. My positive outlook on the
          face of challenge, my understanding of various customs and beliefs and my learning of the importance of
          respecting differences between individuals based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender or nationality is what
          I aspire to contribute as the President of UCSC. My conviction in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one
          family) is what makes me stand out as a strong candidate.
